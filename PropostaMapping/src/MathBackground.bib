abstract = {Directional maximum (DM) technique for processing ultrasonic arc maps (UAMs) is proposed and compared to existing techniques. It employs directional processing in extracting the map of the environment from UAMs. DM aims at overcoming the intrinsic angular uncertainty of ultrasonic sensors in map building, as well as eliminating noise and cross-talk related misreadings. The comparison is based on experiments with a mobile robot which acquired ultrasonic range measurements through wall following. Three complementary performance criteria are used. The DM technique offers a very good compromise between mean absolute error and correct detection rate, with a processing time less than one tenth of a second. It is also superior in range accuracy and in eliminating artifacts, resulting in the best overall performance. The results indicate several trade-offs in the choice of UAM processing techniques.},

abstract = {We study the assimilation of uncertain physical knowledge across space and time, and we discuss the resulting issues of environmental inference and prediction. The term "assimilation" refers to a general framework that includes physical knowledge integration and processing activities in a variety of scientific disciplines (atmospheric data analysis and weather forecasting, environmental pollution mapping, exposure assessment, etc.). The choice of an adequate assimilation approach is primarily a conceptual modelling affair that is supported by the physical and logical features of the environmental situation under consideration, rather than merely relying on pure inductive schemes and statistical arguments. In many cases, the assimilation approach involves conditionalization techniques which enable it to merge various forms of site-specific data with modelling frameworks. We distinguish between interpretive conditionalization (which refers to the physical and epistemic characteristics of assimilation modelling) and formal conditionalization (which is a purely mathematical construction), and emphasize the importance of an adequate choice of the latter to represent the former. We point out the considerable improvements of the operational Bayesian conditionalization approach over the standard Bayesian rule. Statistical learning techniques are useful at the descriptive/correlation level of scientific inquiry, whereas the level of explanation/prediction is the domain of advanced operational techniques. An operational approach is based on an epistemic view in which the relevant natural processes are represented in terms of spatiotemporal random fields and the probability laws are expressed in terms of physically meaningful operators. The spirit of this view is to keep the field solutions consistent with the site-specific information (hard data, uncertain observations, etc.) while exactly satisfying the constraints arising from general knowledge sources (physical laws, primitive equations, scientific theories, etc.). Natural field probabilities in space and time are derived for non-Bayesian operational conditionals based on deductively sound inference, which are valid for a wide variety of knowledge bases. Analytical and numerical comparisons are made between Bayesian and non-Bayesian conditionals, and insight is gained in terms of examples and applications which cut across various earth science disciplines. Operational Bayesian conditionalization is a powerful and versatile component of assimilation modelling with many applications in environmental sciences, although in certain cases a non-Bayesian conditional (based on deductive logic and the characterization of physical connection) may provide a meaningful description of the data assimilation framework suggested by the laws of nature. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Blanco2008,
abstract = {This paper introduces a new approach to simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) that pursues robustness and accuracy in large-scale environments. Like most successful works on SLAM, we use Bayesian filtering to provide a probabilistic estimation that can cope with uncertainty in the measurements, the robot pose, and the map. Our approach is based on the reconstruction of the robot path in a hybrid discrete-continuous state space, which naturally combines metric and topological maps. There are two fundamental characteristics that set this paper apart from previous ones: 1) the use of a unified Bayesian inference approach both for the metrical and the topological parts of the problem and 2) the analytical formulation of belief distributions over hybrid maps, which allows us to maintain the spatial uncertainty in large spaces more accurately and efficiently than in previous works. We also describe a practical implementation that aims for real-time operation. Our ideas have been validated by promising experimental results in large environments (up to 30 000 m<sup>2</sup>, a 2 km robot path) with multiple nested loops, which could hardly be managed appropriately by other approaches.},

Research findings can be applied not only to robotics but to planning routes on circuit boards, directing digital actors in computer graphics, robot-assisted surgery and medicine, and in novel areas such as drug design and protein folding. This text reflects the great advances that have taken place in the last ten years, including sensor-based planning, probabalistic planning, localization and mapping, and motion planning for dynamic and nonholonomic systems. Its presentation makes the mathematical underpinnings of robot motion accessible to students of computer science and engineering, rleating low-level implementation details to high-level algorithmic concepts.},
