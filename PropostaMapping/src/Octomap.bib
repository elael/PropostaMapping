abstract = {In this paper, we present an approach for modeling 3D environments based on octrees using a probabilistic occupancy estimation. Our technique is able to represent full 3D models including free and unknown areas. It is available as an open-source library to facilitate the development of 3D mapping systems. We also provide a detailed review of existing approaches to 3D modeling. Our approach was thoroughly evaluated using different real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach is able to model the data probabilistically while, at the same time, keeping the memory requirement at a minimum.},
