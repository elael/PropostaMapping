abstract = {In this paper we describe a system for underwater navigation with AUVs in partially structured environments, such as dams, ports or marine platforms. An imaging sonar is used to obtain information about the location of planar structures present in such environments. This information is incorporated into a feature-based SLAM algorithm in a two step process: (I) the full 360deg sonar scan is undistorted (to compensate for vehicle motion), thresholded and segmented to determine which measurements correspond to planar environment features and which should be ignored; and (2) SLAM proceeds once the data association is obtained: both the vehicle motion and the measurements whose correct association has been previously determined are incorporated in the SLAM algorithm. This two step delayed SLAM process allows to robustly determine the feature and vehicle locations in the presence of large amounts of spurious or unrelated measurements that might correspond to boats, rocks, etc. Preliminary experiments show the viability of the proposed approach},

abstract = {In this paper, a new method for the estimation of seabed elevation maps from side-scan sonar images is presented. The side-scan image formation process is represented by a Lambertian diffuse model, which is then inverted by a multiresolution optimization procedure inspired by expectation-maximization to account for the characteristics of the imaged seafloor region. On convergence of the model, approximations for seabed reflectivity, side-scan beam pattern, and seabed altitude are obtained. The performance of the system is evaluated against a real structure of known dimensions. Reconstruction results for images acquired by different sonar sensors are presented. Applications to augmented reality for the simulation of targets in sonar imagery are also discussed.},

abstract = {This paper compares two well known scan matching algorithms: the MbICP and the pIC. As a result of the study, it is proposed the MSISpIC, a probabilistic scan matching algorithm for the localization of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The technique uses range scans gathered with a Mechanical Scanning Imaging Sonar (MSIS), and the robot displacement estimated through dead-reckoning with the help of a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) and a Motion Reference Unit (MRU). The proposed method is an extension of the pIC algorithm. Its major contribution consists in: 1) using an EKF to estimate the local path traveled by the robot while grabbing the scan as well as its uncertainty and 2) proposing a method to group into a unique scan, with a convenient uncertainty model, all the data grabbed along the path described by the robot. The algorithm has been tested on an AUV guided along a 600m path within a marina environment with satisfactory results.},

The technique incorporate probabilistic scan matching with range scans gathered from a mechanical scanning imaging sonar (MSIS) and the robot dead-reckoning displacements estimated from a Doppler velocity log (DVL) and a motion reference unit (MRU). The proposed method utilizes two extended Kalman filters (EKF). The first, estimates the local path travelled by the robot while grabbing the scan as well as its uncertainty and provides position estimates for correcting the distortions that the vehicle motion produces in the acoustic images. The second is an augment state EKF that estimates and keeps the registered scans poses. The raw data from the sensors are processed and fused in-line. No priory structural information or initial pose are considered. The algorithm has been tested on an AUV guided along a 600 m path within a marina environment, showing the viability of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {A method for solving the specular reflection problem of sonar systems has been developed and implemented. This method, the specular reflection probability method, permits the robot to construct a high-quality probability map of an environment composed of specular surfaces. The method uses two parameters, the range confidence factor (RCF) and orientation probability. The RCF is the measure of confidence in the returning range from a sensor under a reflective environment, and the factor will have low values for long range information and vice versa. Orientation probability represents the surface orientation of an object. Bayesian reasoning is used to update the orientation probability from the range readings of the sensor},

abstract = {This paper describes a method to estimate the three-dimensional aspects of underwater objects using a sequence of sonar images. The data are recorded by a sector scanning sonar, carried by an underwater vehicle which follows a circular track around the object. The sonar images are segmented into three kinds of regions : echo, shadow and background. The echo information corresponds to the signal back-scattered by the object while the shadow is due to the absence of back-scattering from behind the object. The remaining information composes the background. The reconstruction scheme processes the echo and shadow information separately. A two-dimensional elevation map is estimated from the shadow information and a two-dimensional reflection map is computed from the echoes. The final reconstruction merges these two maps},

@article{Rosenblum1992,
abstract = {A high-resolution, very compact acoustic lens sonar was used to investigate how well small underwater objects can be reconstructed in 3D. The purpose was to develop an acoustic snapshot approaching photographic quality in turbid water where cameras and lens are ineffective. In-water experiments have provided data from an 8-by-8 array of acoustical beams with 1.5 degree conical resolution. Algorithms have been developed to interpolate the conical grid onto a grid. Once gridded, a volume rendering algorithm was applied to produce a full 3D rendering of the object. The sensitivity of this process to different gridding algorithms is evaluated. It is shown that objects can be quantified in size quite precisely. The degree to which shape can be extracted and small details made visible is discussed. The authors also consider how well the reconstruction can be improved by using multiple passes over the object. Registration algorithms are presented, and it is shown that the alignment process can be done with enough accuracy to improve the image and provide greater detail about the object},

abstract = {We describe the use of multiple wide-angle sonar range measurements to map the surroundings of an autonomous mobile robot. A sonar range reading provides information concerning empty and occupied volumes in a cone (subtending 30 degrees in our case) in front of the sensor. The reading is modelled as probability profiles projected onto a rasterized map, where somewhere occupied and everywhere empty areas are represented. Range measurements from multiple points of view (taken from multiple sensors on the robot, and from the same sensors after robot moves) are systematically integrated in the map. Overlapping empty volumes re-inforce each other, and serve to condense the range of occupied volumes. The map definition improves as more readings are added. The final map shows regions probably occupied, probably unoccupied, and unknown areas. The method deals effectively with clutter, and can be used for motion planning and for extended landmark recognition. This system has been tested on the Neptune mobile robot at CMU.},
