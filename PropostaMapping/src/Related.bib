@article{Cagniart2010,
abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of tracking the temporal evolution of arbitrary shapes observed in multi-camera setups. This is motivated by the ever growing number of applications that require consistent shape information along temporal sequences. The approach we propose considers a temporal sequence of independently reconstructed surfaces and iteratively deforms a reference mesh to fit these observations. To effectively cope with outlying and missing geometry, we introduce a novel probabilistic mesh deformation framework. Using generic local rigidity priors and accounting for the uncertainty in the data acquisition process, this framework effectively handles missing data, relatively large reconstruction artefacts and multiple objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method on various 4D datasets.},

@article{Burgard1996,
abstract = {In order to re-use existing models of the environment mobile robots must be able to estimate their position and orientation in such models. Most of the existing methods for position estimation are based on special purpose sensors or aim at tracking the robots position relative to the known starting point. This paper describes the position probability grid approach to estimating the robots absolute position and orientation in a metric model of the environment. Our method is designed to work with standard sensors and is independent of any knowledge about the starting point. It is a Bayesian approach based on certainty grids. In each cell of such a grid we store the probability that this cell refers to the current position of the robot. These probabilities are obtained by integrating the likelihoods of sensor readings over time. Results described in this paper show that our technique is able to reliably estimate the position of a robot in complex environments. Our approach has proven to be robust with respect to inaccurate environmental models, noisy sensors, and ambiguous situations.},

@article{Gu2009,
abstract = {This paper reviews the fundamentals of Radon-based methods using examples from global seismic applications. By exploiting the move-out or curvature of signal of interest, Least-squares and High-resolution Radon transform methods can effectively eliminate random or correlated noise, enhance signal clarity, and simultaneously constrain travel time and ray angles. The inverse formulation of the Radon transform has the added benefits of phase isolation and spatial interpolation during data reconstruction. This study presents a ‘cookbook’ for Radon-based methods in analyzing shear wave bottom-side reflections from mantle interfaces, also know as SS precursors. We demonstrate that accurate and flexible joint Radon- and frequency-domain approaches are particularly effective in resolving the presence and depth of known and postulated mantle reflectors},
